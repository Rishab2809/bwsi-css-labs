    print("Hi everyone! I’m Rishab Gokuldas, a 10th grader from California. I am super passionate about aerospace engineering, mechatronics, drones, uses of AIin these types of things, and other types of robotics. I’ve been into drones for a longgg time now, and have taken shots from all around the world with my cinematic. More recently, about a year ago, I discovered FPV drones, and all of a sudden, that was the end of my cinematic drone. I have been absolutely obsessed with FPV systems, doing crazy amounts of research on them, practicing a ton in simulators, and saving up for a custom build which I am almost at my goal for. Aside from drones, I love the hands-on side of engineering, I'm currently building an autonomous rover with a Rocker-Bogie suspension and using an RGBD camera for vision and 3D mapping. I also love testing the limits and exploring possibilities of my gear, like bypassing the firmware on my Elegoo 3D printer to build a custom Multi-Material System. I have also done many robotics competitions, starting with FLL as a child, moving to VEX, and recently to FTC, where I am now on my high schools Varsity build team. I am learning python right now, but I have also learned C++, javascript, html, and dabbled in others. From a non-engineering side, I love dogs more than anything. I have wanted one since I knew what they were, and it has been the only thing on my Christmas list every year since then. Something must have worked, because I am actually getting one soon. I also love volleyball and have been playing for over 5 years for club and school teams. I am sooo excited for this course because it is quite literally the combination of my biggest passions. Excited to meet you all!")
